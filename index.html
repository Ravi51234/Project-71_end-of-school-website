      <p class="text-muted">There are aspects of life that everybody takes part in. Two of those things, at least here in the south, is going to church and school. Going to church on a Sunday morning is just as routine as going to school on Monday morning. People go to church and listen to the pastor give his or her sermon for the day like one would go to school and listen to the teacher give his or her lesson for the day. Both play a role in everyday life for people and can have major effects in people’s lives. The similarities of church and school are interesting to look at, as are the differences. To begin with, the practice of going to church has been around longer than that of attending school has been. Attending church is where people back in the 15th and 16th …show more content…
        Church is there for when people want to look to a higher power other than themselves. The Church can be a great and powerful thing, but if solely relied on for everything it can be a bit confusing when facing different situations. School, however, can show us the answer to these situations. Math, science, and english can show us the answers to the questions we have and how to solve those questions we have. What a pastor has to say will most likely be different than that of a teacher. As of lately, schools have not been open minded to letting the church be involved inside the walls. No prayer or other religion activities are to be lead by teachers or other faculty members, while the church pushes for these things to happen.</p>

      <p class="text-muted">A library is a location where numerous collections of books are kept. The extensive library at my school is next to the auditorium. Once a week, our class goes to the library. Our library has a variety of picture books, novels, comics, and other materials.

        Due to my passion for reading books and magazines, I look forward to my time in the library. The reading area in my school's library is a big table surrounded by bookcases. We refer to the books in our library when we have any assignments to complete. I also use my free time to visit the school library. We can also issue the library books and take them home.My school has a large library with a wide selection of books on many subjects. Twice a week, we have designated time for the library. Each class has a library period during the weekly schedule. My greatest reason to go to the library is that I can read my favourite books there. My school's library is tastefully decorated. It is a sizable hall that is well illuminated and ventilated. There is a huge section in the middle intended for seating children. We sit in rows most of the time. The books are arranged all around the seating area.</p>

      <p class="tetx-muted">I read in a very big school. Likewise, it has a big hall. It is also known as the auditorium. It has a sound-proof system in it such that any voice or sound in it does not echo awfully.

        It is situated in the main building in the centre of the school. It has five doors and a number of windows. It is air-conditioned but has electric fans also which are put to work if ever the AC system fails. They are also worked with a generator when there is an electric breakdown and the AC system does not work.
        
        There is a vast dais at the end of the hall. The dais is quite high and there are stairs to climb it has a curtain for dramatic performances. There is also a lecture stand there for the speakers. A mike is there which is put to use when necessary.
        
        The front door is the widest. The four other doors two in the either wall are ‘comparatively less wide. Besides, there are two small doors behind the dais which open into small green houses.</p>

    <p>I spoke that Pollution is one of the greatest challenges the world is facing today. It is the introduction of harmful pollutants in the environment that degrades the quality of air, water, and soil. As human civilization progressed, we invented machines and products that can ease our life. During this process, we exploited nature, and started polluting it. We are in a time of crisis where the glaciers in Antarctica are melting due to global warming.Pollution not only affects the environment but also introduces diseases that could kill all living organisms. Toxic chemicals released in water have killed aquatic life and also reduced the quality of water. Toxic gasses released in the air cause different lung diseases such as asthma etc. More and more legislative acts are passed to control pollution and it has been adopted by governments all around the world. However, only legislative acts and protocols cannot help in controlling the pollution as it is the duty of every individual to act on his or her own to control pollution. It is also very important that children from an early age should be educated about pollution and the effect it has on the environment and their future.

        Two months ago, I had the privilege of taking part in an inter-school extempore competition. First, a screening contest was held in our school. Around twenty students delivered a speech on the topic. “Is the education of women necessary for the upliftment of Indian society? We all had prepared well, but the final result had the names of the best three participants only. My joy knew no bounds, when I saw my name in the list. I had no idea that I would be selected. I had done well, no doubt, but to represent my school in an inter-school competition was a very big responsibility.The competition was a month away. A month? It was too short a time to prepare on all the topic under the sun, I selected a number of recent topics and started preparing myself earnestly. I wanted to win laurels for my school. It did not mater to me if I did not win, but at the same time, I wanted to earn a good reputation for my school. My father helped me a lot, he would point out weaknesses, and within a month, I was ready to face the contest.

    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-sx-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-sx-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

      Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.
      
      To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work.
      
      An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.The attendance management system is a tool that keeps track of employee and student attendance in institutes. It gives complete data about the time the students are present in the institute and the time they take off. This process can be conducted by recording student and employee hours using online attendance software for your company.

      An attendance management system is used by an organization to track staff's time and attendance details. You can save time and effort by calculating your employee's working hours with an accurate attendance management system.
      
      A school attendance management system is a solution that conducts tracking, monitoring, and compiling daily student attendance data through an online medium. It enables the faculty to record and maintain 100% accurate student attendance reports, attendance history, absentee records, & other activities within a few clicks.
      
      Attendance management system keeps track of daily attendance, working hours, breaks, login, and logout time. It prevents staff's time theft. An attendance management system integrates all attendance devices such as smart cards, biometric, and facial recognition devices in real-time.
